      My name is Michael Taub Joyce.  My first name comes from the Hebrew phrase "Who is like God?", my middle name comes from the Tauba River and means 'Dove' in Yiddish/German, and my last name belongs to one of the Twelve Tribes of Galway, which I believe has its origins in the latin 'Iodocus' (Lord).

      I was born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri, and after years of sojourning I have returned back home, to the confluence of the two longest rivers on the continent.
